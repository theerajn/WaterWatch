<ul id="content">
    <li>Mandatory Installation of Water-Efficient Fixtures: Enforce regulations that require the installation of water-efficient fixtures such as low-flow toilets, faucets, and showerheads in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.</li>

    <li>Prohibition of Wasteful Practices: Implement rules that prohibit wasteful practices such as leaving taps running unnecessarily, hosing down sidewalks, or using water for non-essential purposes like decorative fountains during drought periods.</li>

    <li>Water Metering and Monitoring: Require water metering and monitoring systems in all properties to track water usage accurately. Implement penalties or incentives based on water consumption levels to encourage conservation.</li>

    <li>Leak Detection and Repair Requirements: Mandate regular inspections for leaks in plumbing systems and infrastructure. Property owners should be required to promptly repair any leaks identified to prevent water loss.</li>

    <li>Landscaping Regulations: Enforce landscaping regulations that promote water-efficient practices, such as the use of drought-resistant plants, mulching, and drip irrigation systems. Limit or discourage the use of water-intensive turfgrass in favor of native or low-water-use landscaping.</li>

    <li>Education and Public Awareness Programs: Develop educational campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of water conservation and the impact of wasteful practices. Provide resources and incentives for individuals, businesses, and communities to adopt water-saving behaviors and technologies.</li>
